Machine learning engineer / data scientist / dabbler in full-stack
and iOS development.

I'm a consultant data scientist who has developed software
for particle accelerators,
built models to assess COVID spread,
used XAI to identify novel,
life-saving drugs,
among other things.
I'm a privacy
and open-source
enthusiast,
working on developing
[the future on machine learning][openmined]
in my spare time.
