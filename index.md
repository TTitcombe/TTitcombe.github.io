## About Me

Machine learning engineer / data scientist / dabbler in full-stack
and iOS development.

I'm a consultant data scientist who has developed software
for particle accelerators,
built models to assess COVID spread,
used XAI to identify novel,
life-saving drugs,
among other things.
I'm a privacy
and open-source
enthusiast,
working on developing
[the future on machine learning][openmined]
in my spare time.

### I'm learning :book::

- MERN stack
- D3 (data viz tool)

### I'm getting better at :seedling::

- Swift
- CoreML
- React js
- Differential privacy
- Reinforcement learning

### I'm pretty good at :star::

- Python
- Data science
- Machine learning
- Deep learning
- MLOps
- Federated learning
- Good code
  - Writing actually useful documentation
  - git workflow
  - Pull requests and code review
